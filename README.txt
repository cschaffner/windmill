Django project for using leaguevine.com via its API for Windmill Windup 2013.

UPDATE (Jan 2013):
I am re-using the software from last year to handle some stuff of this year's edition of Windmill Windup as well.



Version 1.0 (from 2012):
Everything is experimental up to now!

Windmill Windup 2012 is over, the first 3 scripts will not be developped any further.
If you are interested in using any of this, please contact Christian Schaffner (huebli@mgail.com)

This project consists of 4 modules:
1. Leaguevine control tool
2. SMS functionality
3. Spirit scores
4. Power Rankings
